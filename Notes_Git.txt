Git is an application used to save your source code or file, and serves as version control system

git clone <repository_url>   -> to check out a repository from git
git pull <branch_name> -> to get latest changes from branch, if you dont give branch name it will pull changes from the current branch you are in

to commit your changes to the repository
git status -> gives you the status of your uncommitted changes
git add <file_name> -> adds specified file to your commit, if you want to add all your changes run git add .(dot, denotes ALL)
git push -> pushes your changes to the current branch you are in, after this your changes can be viewed by others provided they have permissions to do source
